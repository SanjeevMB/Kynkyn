Even if I do not pick up anything, the gallery transports me to another world and I come out feeling at peace. The art and the curator both leave you moved.</p><p>So many of my friends and family have shipped pieces abroad, sometimes at very short notice, but KYNKYNY, and Shylaja in particular, has been super helpful.

We still spend hours talking about compositions, patterns, proportions and spaces; that's what fed my inspiration to be an Architect. I've grown up watching dad collect art, and I vividly remember him bringing home the first painting from KYNKYNY back in 2005 - a Ganesha by the eminent Basuki Dasgupta. Over the years, many more artworks have been added to his collection by the likes of G Subramanian, JMS Mani, Siva Balan, Jean Letschert, Elayaraja, SG Vasudev, Raghava KK, Amit Bhar, Jasu Rawal and the list goes on. Now, we've lost count on the number of pieces of art and furniture we've snapped up from KYNKYNY.</p><p>As for myself, I've just started collecting pieces for my own caboodle, many of which are from KYNKYNY. The gallery is a great platform for contemporary Indian artists and art lovers alike. It's discernible that we absolutely adore KYNKYNY; both the people and the art that they curate.\"</p>",
