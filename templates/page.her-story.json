Her latest series entitled, “Between the Mirror and Bindi - Two dimensions of women” is inspired by the intricate mirror work in Kutch textiles and the symbolic red bindi, which represents the journey of a woman’s life. The mirror in her series symbolizes a woman's personal horizon—her physical, social, and emotional universe. Early in life, a woman is consumed by the external world, seeking to create an idealized version of herself. Later, the red bindi represents her transformation into roles of wife and mother, signifying a new phase of growth and adaptation. Bharti’s series powerfully portrays the transitions and complexities of women in rural and urban India, capturing their resilience, strength, and emotional depth.<br/><br/></p>",

Although she lives and works in Bhopal, most of Durgabai’s work is rooted in the rich folklore and mythologies of her birthplace, Burbaspur, a village in the Mandla district of Madhya Pradesh. Her art is inspired by the stories she heard as a child from her grandmother. Post her marriage to Subhash Vyam, she was encouraged by her brother-in-law, Jangarh Singh Shyam, who noticed her talent as a painter of digna (ritual paintings made by the women on the floors and walls of houses). He spurred her to not only translate her talents on to paper and canvas but also to experiment with her aesthetics in keeping with a contemporary urban art market. Even while using the pointillist dots, fine dashes and minute waves that characterise Pardhan-Gond painting, Durgabai’s use of vibrant colours for the stippling is part of her unique voice, and is matched by the fable-like quality of her paintings. They present a range of goddesses, rivers, trees, a variety of animals from tigers and deer to peacocks and garden lizards, and occasionally male gods – all rendered in her original and very contemporary style. Durgabai is also the author and illustrator of several books.</p>",

The process through which she creates her art is akin to a meditative state where she spontaneously connects with colours and the canvas in a lilting, expressionist tango. The abstract paintings which follow these personal experiences are cryptic illustrations of her unique perceptions. A verse in the Bhagavad Gita, a rock, mountain or seascape – each of these shapes her free-flowing, non-figurative works. Kathe believes that the concept of “macrocosm and microcosms” holds infinite possibilities for artists and thinkers. Awash in a symphony of liquid amber, earth tones and ethereal blues, she perceives the world as transient, emphasising the supremacy and eternity of the mind.</p>",

The rich, fragmented and undulating surfaces of her paintings reflect her intuitive process, where the chemical and physical properties of her materials guide the evolution of each piece blending ecology, anthropology and philosophy.Working primarily with a single color on each canvas, Meenal delves into the infinite range of tints and shades, creating compositions that seem to move with striking emotional depth.

The artist then nudges the paint in different directions, repeating the process in layers to create enigmatic, intuitive pieces. On her process, she says, “After all – in life, we only have limited control. For the rest, we need to let things take its course.” Meghana’s earthy, ethereal palettes full of browns, blacks, white and blues resemble elemental natural forces, contributing to this sense of comfort, inner peace, and the idea of giving way, and letting the world take over.</p>",

Her enigmatic canvases transport the viewer into a space of pure sensation, colour, and beingness. Working primarily with acrylics on canvas, her art is often influenced by places that have left an indelible mark on her – from Dehradun where she grew up, to Vietnam, Doha, and Langkawi where she has lived. The mellow and intricate gradations and patterns of deep colours seen in her works — inspired as they are by her memories, reflections, and impressions of these places — are an enigmatic travelogue, a journey of Maithani as both artist and woman.<br/></p>",

As she moved to a large city, she noticed that the calm of nature was replaced by the relentless rush of urban life—the constant hum of cars, hurried footsteps, and a silence where nature once thrived. This shift had a deep impact that began to surface in her dreams. One recurring nightmare featured a world where nature had vanished, leaving only towering buildings behind—a chilling image that resonated with the irregular climate patterns we now witness. This dream became the inspiration for this series, Dream City.Through her work, Payal continues to explore the complex relationship between nature and humanity. As we move forward in our pursuit of progress, we often forget that nature, too, is unstoppable. There is an urgent need to preserve the delicate balance between human advancement and the natural world. Payal strives to show the beauty and importance of this relationship, and the consequences if it is neglected.</p>",

Aelay’s paintings reflect the energy, momentum and simplicity of folk art, as well as the aesthetics and language of contemporary art. Paintings do not follow a linear perspective in the artist’s work, as she plays with space, dimensions and perspective to make the landscapes appear free flowing and free floating.

            "text": "<p>Sujata Achrekar is a Mumbai-based artist whose compelling canvasses reel you in with their hypnotic faces and magnetic colours. Predominantly worked in oils with a profusion of earthy tones like burnt sienna, ochre and rust orange, the canvases occasionally feature white for contrast. However, Achrekar is not averse to more brilliant hues, also using blues, reds and yellows sparingly in her palette. Combining figurative representation with abstract schemas, her works attempts to convey personal reflections. Focussed on a central figure, her canvases create a meditative, pensive and often melancholic mood. Achrekar is particularly recognised for her Brahmin Brahmachari series, in which the figure of a Brahmin boy is foregrounded — tonsured-headed, traditionally attired and often quietly intense — superimposed upon Sanskrit verses and traditional manuscript imagery. Religion however, is not the subject of exploration in her works, which are far more focused on spirituality and the nature of seeking. She also uses various techniques like scratching, overlapping, scrubbing and rollers in order to add a unique textural quality to her canvases.</p>",

            "text": "<p>Nature, fantasy and colour, in all its extraordinary hues, tints and tones, play a significant role in Veenita Chendvankar’s art. A self-confessed dreamer, the Goa-based artist’s acrylics on canvas are magical floating worlds – a free associative collage of her fantasies, memories, sense-impressions and the outpourings of her inner world. The art is purely instinctive and intuitive, needing no intellectual interpretation and analysis. Folk art forms like Madhubani and Warli, heavily influence Chenvankar’s works. She gives these indigenous aesthetics a stylized twist to suit her contemporary sensibilities.</p>",
