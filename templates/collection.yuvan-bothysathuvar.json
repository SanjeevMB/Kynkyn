Coming from this context, his paintings often featured a sombre and mellow mood, showcasing village scenes and everyday life. Using earthy colours – from deep reds and earthy browns to pistachio greens – Shingade showed mastery over technique and meaning. If on the one hand he used mixed media and acrylic layers to impart texture to his artworks for instance, on the other he gave his works meaningful titles that allowed viewers to relate to and appreciate his message.</p><p>Since his early period, Shingade has experimented heavily with his work, influencing not only his visual style but also his artistic sensibility. Over the last decade, there have been several shifts in his artistic expression – the addition of divinity and nature as central themes in his works, a new attention to meticulous detail, the use of bright colours, and most significantly, the opening up of his forms. Previously closed eyes are now rendered open, faces and characters – that had never even had lips before – seem as if on the verge of speech. His canvases now, come alive in new dimensions and contexts, as he transforms from an artist-as-recorder to an artist-as-storyteller.</p>"

His picturesque scenes are meant, in his own words, “to reflect the memories and experiences I have collected from the places I have lived, touched, smelled, heard and walked through.” If his experimentation with figurative and street art led Rao Botcha eventually to natural landscapes, they, in turn, led to him developing an interest in trees – which were to become his leitmotif and the core element of his works.</p><p>For Rao Botcha, trees are culturally significant emblems, deeply embedded in Indian mythological narratives, as well as occupying sacred roles. Further, they assume important roles within the physical landscape, not only yielding fruits but providing shade, as well as covering and protecting the earth’s surface. Rendering trees in myriad mediums, he returns each time to it with a new vision. He notes, “In black and white, sombre greys or bright primary colours, the tree stands out resplendently, a sentinel to remind me of the havoc… [we seem] to cause on the sacred face of the earth in our pursuit of selfish interests…And, yet these works also imbibe my intimate and immensely cherished companionship with nature, which started when I was very young and has become stronger with time.”</p><p></p><p>See more</p>",
